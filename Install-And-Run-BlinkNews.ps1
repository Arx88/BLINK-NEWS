<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Installs and runs the BLINK NEWS application.
    This script attempts to install necessary dependencies including Python, Node.js (with npm), and pnpm using winget,
    then sets up the Python virtual environment, installs dependencies, and launches the backend and frontend.
.DESCRIPTION
    Detailed steps:
    1. Checks for winget.
    2. Installs Python via winget if not found.
    3. Installs Node.js LTS (with npm) via winget if not found.
    4. Creates a Python virtual environment (blink_venv).
    5. Installs Python requirements from requirements.txt.
    6. Installs pnpm globally via npm.
    7. Starts the backend Flask server.
    8. Starts the frontend Vite development server.
    Requires PowerShell 5.1 or later.
    May require Administrator privileges for winget installations or to set Execution Policy.
